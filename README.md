2. Analysis of the main research question - what is the association between BMI and mortality for different time horizons.<br>
   We examined the effect of BMI, age and gender on hospitalization mortality in three time frames - immediate time (up to 3 months), 1 year and 5 years.<br>
   We used 3 different analysis methods:<br>
    - Logistic regression on continuous BMI
    - Logistic regression on BMI groups
    - Survival analysis

   We examined the effect of BMI, age and gender on additional hospitalization outcomes such as the duration of hospitalization and occurrence of re-hospitalizations.
   
4. Analysis of confounding variables<br>
   We examined through logistic regression whether there are confounding variables such as background diseases, infectious diseases and measurement variables.

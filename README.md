2. Analysis of the main research question - what is the association between BMI and mortality for different time horizons.
   We examined the effect of BMI, age and gender on hospitalization mortality in three ways:
    - Logistic regression on continuous BMI
    - Logistic regression on BMI groups
    - Survival analysis

3. Analysis of the second research question - what is the association of BMI and additional hospitalization outcomes:
   We examined the effect of BMI, age and gender on additional hospitalization outcomes such as the duration of hospitalization and occurrence of re-hospitalizations.
   
4. Analysis of confounding variables
   We examined through logistic regression whether there are confounding variables such as background diseases, infectious diseases and measurement variables.
